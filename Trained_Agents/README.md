## Pre-Trained Agents
These agents have already been trained under various conditions. Download them into your opensim-rl environment and save as "KerasDDPGAgent_actor.h5f and KerasDDPGAgent_critic.h5f" or "TensorforcePPOAgent" to test, visualize, or continue to train them. Filenames indicate how many episodes they have trained. "acts01", "acts025", or "acts05" indicate that a muscle was restricted to a binary activation of 0 and .25, .5, or 1, respectively. Reward functions are also briefly described: they may include matching pelvis and/or torso velocities, not falling, minimizing activations, and keeping the torso in front of the pelvis.
